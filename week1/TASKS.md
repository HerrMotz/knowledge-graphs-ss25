| MOD.1      | Review | Motivate your ontology with a set of at least twenty competency questions or statements and document those . The ontology should abstract knowledge about the domain, valid for the data at hand but potentially valid for other datasets (e.g., tables). The ontology should, in principle, only contain concepts, object and data properties. Tip: you should differentiate between the general concept Margherita_Pizza and the margherita pizza served at “Pizzeria da Mario” | 10%    |
| MOD.2      | Done   | From the competency questions derive terms and properties that your ontology needs to cover. Derive concepts from those terms and arrange them into a hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 10%    |
| MOD.3      | Done   | Verify the rigidity, identity, and unity of your classes. If changes to your class-hierarchy and/or new properties become necessary, add them to the ontology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 5%     |
