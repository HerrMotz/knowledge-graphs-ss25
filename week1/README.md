# Task: Ontology Modelling

* Subtask MOD.1: Motivate your ontology with a set of at least twenty competency questions or statements and document those . The ontology should abstract knowledge about the domain, valid for the data at hand but potentially valid for other datasets (e.g., tables). The ontology should, in principle, only contain concepts, object and data properties. Tip: you should differentiate between the general concept Margherita_Pizza and the margherita pizza served at “Pizzeria da Mario” (10%).

* Subtask MOD.2: From the competency questions derive terms and properties that your ontology needs to cover. Derive concepts from those terms and arrange them into a hierarchy. (10%)

* Subtask MOD.3: Verify the rigidity, identity, and unity of your classes. If changes to your class-hierarchy and/or new properties become necessary, add them to the ontology. (5%)

The following steps still have some modeling aspects, but can be done directly in OWL. You can (but don't have to) use Protegé.

Subtask OWL.1: Change namespace for the ontology e.g., http://www.uni-jena.de/KG24/your_name/ (5%).

Subtask OWL.2: Create a prefix (e.g., your initials bkr:) for the defined namespace (5%).

* Subtask OWL.3: Create classes according to your model.(5%)

* Subtask OWL.4: Create data and object properties according to your model.(10%)

* Subtask OWL.5: Create local scope property restrictions or global scope ones (i.e., domain and range) as necessary (10%).

* Subtask OWL.6: Create appropriate property characteristics (10%).

* Subtask OWL.7: Create a label (e.g., name or synonym) and a comment (e.g., meaning of the concept) for each created entity (5%).

Subtask OWL.8: Create or reuse an annotation property creator and annotate/indicate the ontology has been created by you (5%).

Of course, the MOD and OWL tasks should be reflected in the report:

Subtask REP.1: Discussion and motivation of the different modelling choices in the report including discussion of changes made in MOD.3 (20%).
