# Week 4 â€” Ontology Alignment

## Starting Considerations

The given external ontology by Rector et al. only describes dishes and what makes them characteristic. For example, the
dishes (or foods) pizza and ice cream are described. _Ice Cream_, _Pizza_, _Pizza Base_ and _Food Topping_ are in the same
ontological hierarchy (using the subclass relation) and all categorised as _Food_. This is a bit confusing, especially 
because _Food Topping_ only has one subclass, namely _Pizza Topping_. More confusingly, _Ice Cream_ can have an instance 
of _Fruit Topping_ (subclass of _Pizza Topping_), with the only subclass being _Sultana Topping_.

## File Overview

| File                                                  | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [aml_alignment.rdf](/week4/outputs/aml_alignment.rdf)         | Alignment generated using AML                                                                                                  |
| [own_alignment.ttl](/week4/outputs/own_alignment.ttl)         | Own Alignment using Sequence Matching and ArgosTranslate                                                                       |
| [bert_raw_mapping.json](/week4/outputs/bert_raw_mapping.json) | BERTMap (as part of the deeponto package, which was extremely difficult to setup and still does not do everything it promises) |

## Command for AgreementMakerLight

```shell
java -Xmx8g -jar AML.jar \
  -s ../week1/ontology.xml \
  -t existing_pizza.ttl \
  -o aml_alignment.rdf \
  -f RDF
```


## Example usage for BERTMap
> [!TIP]
> You will first need to make some _manual_ changes to the package `deeponto` to make some fixes.
> Look in the section below

Run this command from the subfolder `week4`:
```shell
python bertmap_alignment.py ..\week1\ontology.xml existing_pizza.owl -c bertmap_config.yaml --subs-config bertsubs_config.yaml --output bertmap_equivalences.ttl --subs-output bertmap_subsumptions.ttl
```

## Required manual changes to the `deeponto` package

You want to install torch with CUDA support (if you have a CUDA gfx ofc). For CUDA 12.x use also 12.1:

```shell
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

There is a [full guide on installing torch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and which wheels to use for which CUDA version.

Furthermore, there is a bug the ontodeep package for some reason. Go ahead and change line 149 in `.\.venv\site-packages\deeponto\align\mapping.py` to:
```py
if not threshold or dp.Score >= threshold:
```

Once more, you need to change the `__init__.py` for BertSubs located at `venv\Lib\site-packages\deeponto\align\bertsubs\__init__.py`. Replace the code line with:
```py
from deeponto.complete.bertsubs import BERTSubsInterPipeline, DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE_INTER
```

so that it exports the configuration file.
