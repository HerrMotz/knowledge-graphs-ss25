# Week 5 â€” Ontology Alignment

## Calculate embeddings using OWL2Vec*

> [!NOTE]
> This corresponds to the task `Vector.1`.

```shell
python owl2vec.py ../week1/ontology.xml ../week2/pizza_data.ttl --outdir . --sample 500
```

## Pairwise comparison of embeddings
```shell
python pairwise_similarity_tool.py pairs --vec cfg2.vec.txt --pairs pairs.txt --output similarities.txt
```

## Pairwise similarity plot of $k$ random vectors
```shell
python pairwise_similarity_tool.py random --vec cfg2.vec.txt -k 20
```

## File structure overview

The output files will be located in the directory `/week5/`.
