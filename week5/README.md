| File                                            | Description                                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [owl2vec.py](/week5/owl2vec.py)                 | Entry-point or wrapper script for calling OWL2Vec* directly (optional/manual use). |
| [cfg1.ini](/week5/cfg1.ini) (generated)         | OWL2Vec* configuration file (first version).                                       |
| [cfg1.vec.bin](/week5/cfg1.vec.bin) (generated) | Binary vector file generated by OWL2Vec* using `cfg1.ini`.                         |
| [cfg1.vec.txt](/week5/cfg1.vec.txt) (generated) | Human-readable vector file (text format) from the first OWL2Vec* run.              |
| [cfg1_cache](/week5/cfg1_cache) (generated)     | Cache directory generated during the first OWL2Vec* run.                           |
| [cfg2.ini](/week5/cfg2.ini) (generated)         | OWL2Vec* configuration file (second run).                                          |
| [cfg2.vec.bin](/week5/cfg2.vec.bin) (generated) | Binary vector file generated by OWL2Vec* using `cfg2.ini`.                         |
| [cfg2.vec.hdr](/week5/cfg2.vec.hdr) (generated) | Header file for `cfg2.vec.txt` (reconstructed, as OWL2Vec* omits it).              |
| [cfg2.vec.txt](/week5/cfg2.vec.txt) (generated) | Human-readable vector file (text format) from the second OWL2Vec* run.             |
| [cfg2_cache](/week5/cfg2_cache) (generated)     | Cache directory generated during the second OWL2Vec* run.                          |
| [merged.owl](/week5/merged.owl) (generated)     | The ontology merged with tabular data (output of the first step of the pipeline).  |
